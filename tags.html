	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Cory Eckley, I am a spohomore at UW, and I'm an aspiring Math Major. I've lived in Washington my entire life and was born in Everett, Washington. I then moved to Lake Stevens, where I have spent the last 16 years living. Fun fact, Chris Pratt is from Lake Stevens, and even occasionally visits the town.</p>
	<p>I love being outside and playing sports, specifically Football, Baseball, and Basketball. I also like to Fish and Hike, which I do along with my brother and cousin, who currently go to school up in Bellingham, WA. I also enjoy playing videogames and watching TV in my sparetime, however with school I haven't been able to play as much.</p>
